       <p>Gangaramaya Temple is one of the most important temples in Colombo, Sri Lanka, being a mix of modern architecture and cultural essence. Located on Beira Lake, it was completed in the late 19th century.
    </p> 
    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>The temple's architecture demonstrates an eclectic mix of Sri Lankan, Thai, Indian, and Chinese architecture.
        This Buddhist temple includes several imposing buildings and is situated not far from the placid waters of Beira Lake on a plot of land that was originally a small hermitage on a piece of marshy land. It has the main features of a Vihara (temple), the Cetiya (Pagoda) the Bodhi tree, the Vihara Mandiraya, the Seema Malaka (assembly hall for monks), and the Relic Chamber. In addition, a museum, a library, a residential hall, a three-storeyed Pirivena, educational halls, and an alms hall are also on the premises.
        Most notable for tourists is the architecture of the Simamalaka Shrine, which was built with donations from a Muslim sponsor to the design of Geoffrey Bawa.
        </p>
    <h2>Famous incumbents</h2>  
    <p>It was the home for erudite scholars such as Ratmalana Sri Dharmarama Thero, Waskaduwa Sri Subhuti Thero, Weligama Sri Sumangala Thero, Welivitiye Dhammaratna Thero, and Pandit Batuwantudawe.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Don Bastian (de Silva Jayasuriya Goonewardane, Mudaliyar), a 19th-century shipping merchant who was seeking suitable land to build a temple for the Matara Sri Dharmarama there, bought a beautiful tract belonging to three Moors and filled and prepared the land at great expense. The land was bordered on two sides by the Moragoda Ela and the Pettigala Ela was used to build the temple, which was subsequently named the Padawthota Gangaramaya Viharaya. The Mudaliyar, with the assistance of the people, built a great 'Chaitya' (Dagaba) of 30 Riyans and built a great decorative arch (Khorana) and a 'Sandakada pahana' modeled on the ones found at Anuradhapura, at the entrance to the temple. A 'Bo' sapling brought from the great Sri Maha Bhodiya in Anuradhapura, was planted with his own hands and nurtured. He also built a three-storied preaching hall, walls, railings, and the moat around the temple.</p>
