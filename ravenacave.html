        <p>The Ravana Cave has located about 2 km from the Ella town and 11 km (7 mi) away from Bandarawela. It is quite a small cave, measuring about 50ft wide, 150ft long, and 60ft high. History says that the cave is used by King Rawana to hide Princess Sita.
            The cave lies 1,370 m (4,490 ft) above sea level on the foundation of a cliff and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Sri Lanka with a historical value.

        <h2>How to Get here</h2>
        <p>first come to Maha Ravana Viharaya and Ravana Cave is just 1km away from there, climb up the steep path that led towards the cave. The climb is quite tough with about 650 steps - uneven steps, many of them are quite steep; some places had no steps at all - just on steep rocks.
            The last few feet are the toughest as one had to climb up without anything to hold on to.
            The cave-in itself is not very impressive to someone who has very high expectations. Mainly because it is a tough climb and once you reach the place you will only see a small cave.

        <h2>About Ravana Cave</h2>
        <p>Like the Sthripura Cave in Welimada, legend has it that it was used by King Rawana to hide Princess Sita. It is also thought to be connected to the cave at the Dowa rock temple in Bandarawela (part of King Walagamba's famous 'tunnel network'). Archaeological findings include a human skull dating back to 20,000 BC.
            These tunnels prove beyond doubt the architectural brilliance of King Ravana. The tunnels served as a quick means of transport through the hills and also as a secret passage. They networked all the important cities, airports, and dairy farms. A close look at these tunnels indicates that they are man-made and not natural formations.
            Existing tunnel mouths are also situated at Ishtripura in Welimada, Senapitiya in Halagala, Ramboda, Labookelle, Wariyapola in Matale, and Seetha Kotuwa in Hasalaka and many more places.
