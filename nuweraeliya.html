        <p>Meaning that this is the place that has the highest gap in Sri Lanka. Situated at the border of Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, and Ratnapura districts and Horton Plains, which is the highest plain in Sri Lanka. This place highlights the rich bio-diversity of Sri Lanka. This is a trail with a remarkable diversity of terrain, weather, vegetation, etc. It starts off with a stretch across the beautiful paddy fields. Climb through pines plots, grasslands, Montana forest patches, tea estates, and finally through a cloud forest to reach Worlds End. One can view the town of Balangoda which is located way below your point of observation. Walk alone through the silent plain of Horton plain to the end of the world. Stand 2000 Metres high at the edge of the cold frosted grassland and lower your eyes towards the next landmark - the tea plantations 900 Meters below. Gaze onward beyond the waves of mountains, the filigree of waterfalls, hazy lakes, and paddy fields to the pink salters of Hambantota and shining sea in a horizontal sweep</p>

        <p>One of the most jaw-dropping experiences you can ever have in Sri Lanka is the World’s End on the Horton Plains. Enjoy a tuk-tuk ride to the Horton Plains from Nuwara Eliya and it is among the best tourist places to visit in Sri Lanka.

            You can see animals such as leopards and deer. Experience the amazing flora and fauna which will be an amazing experience.
            
            Location: The nearest station is in Nanu Oya which is about 8km.
            
            Highlights: Baker’s fall which is truly spectacular
            
            Best Time to Visit: The best time to reach there is before 10:00 AM before it gets too cloudy because you will not be able to see anything after that.
