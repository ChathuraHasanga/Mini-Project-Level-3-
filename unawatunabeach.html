        <p>Unawatuna is a coastal town in the Galle district of Sri Lanka. Unawatuna is a major tourist attraction in Sri Lanka and is known for its beach and corals. It is a suburb of Galle, about 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) southeast of the city center and approximately 108 kilometers (67 mi) south of Colombo. Unawatuna is situated at an elevation of 5 meters (16 ft) above sea level. Despite significant development in the last decade, it is still home to the endangered and endemic purple-faced langur, an usually shy monkey species that can only be found in Sri Lanka's forests.

        <h2>Dagoba in Unawatuna</h2>
        <p>In later years a Budge, or House of Buddha, and the Swethamalee Chaitiya, or Dagaba, was built on the hillock abutting the Devalaya, or House of Gods. Thousands of pilgrims throng to this place of worship every month of Esala to offer poojas. This festival is a new rice offering so most cultivators bring a share of their crop and pray for timely rain and plentiful harvest. Some others save a fistful of rice from their daily meal and offer that rice, still, others would purchase a few measures or even full gunnies of rice along with coconuts to offer.
            This rice is pounded and mixed with coconut milk and treacle and made into a porridge which is then offered to the deities at the devalaya and given as alms to thousands of devotees who will trek to the devalaya for this almsgiving or Maha Deva Dana or Kiri Dana. Fisherfolk saves and offers part of their earnings called "Goda kotasa" seeking protection on their forays into the ocean.

        <h2>Colonial period</h2>
        <p>After defeating the Portuguese at the Fort of Negombo, the Dutch sailed south and landed on Unawatuna in 1640, and marched to Galle. The Portuguese had encountered the Dutch soldiers at Magalle (where the Closenberg Hotel is now located), and fierce fighting took place there. Over 400 Dutch soldiers were killed, and only 49 Portuguese could manage to get back to their fortification in Galle, where they were held in siege for four days before they surrendered.
            The Dutch built houses for their officials in Unawatuna. These constructions include the Nooit Gedacht Hotel, Unawatuna Hospital, and the mansion Maharambe. The UBR hotel is situated on land called Parangiyawatta, meaning "land of the Portuguese", and the area nearby is known as Ja-kotuwa, suggesting that it was the settlement of Ja or Javanese people better known as Hollanders and there may have been some fortification.
            The Galle tower or Edward's Pillar on Rumassala Hill is believed to have been a fake lighthouse built during World War I, and the area is shown as property of the British Admiralty in old survey maps.

        <h2>Eco-Tourism</h2>

            Unawatuna is rich in its biodiversity. Its greatest potential attraction for eco-tourism was the marshland or mangrove, Kadolana, which was partially dredged and filled to develop a hotel for a German hotel chain. The development never eventuated. Many locals believe it to have been cursed for being built at the doorstep of the Wella Devalaya.[citation needed]
            Over sixty species of endemic birds, including terns, egrets, herons, sandpipers, and kingfishers, as well as rarer species such as the lesser whistling duck, the Asian palm swift, the white-breasted waterhen, the Loten's sunbird, and the black bittern have been sighted in the locality by the ornithologist, Clive Byers. These birds are mostly sighted in the remaining marshy area and Rumassala Hillock.
            Off the coast of Unawatuna, beneath the Indian Ocean lies several coral reefs, shipwrecks, and a great variety of fish and turtles. The turtles still wade onto the shore to lay their nests and eggs, and at times, as if to lay first claim to the sandy shore now invaded by the tourists and dotted by restaurateurs, even go right into the beachfront restaurants.
            The Rumassala coral reefs at the east end of the Galle Harbor attract divers but are now endangered due to possible port development.[citation needed] Eco treks in the shrub jungles of Rumassala are also available.
